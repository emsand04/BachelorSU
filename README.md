# BachelorSU
This is the bachelor work of two students at Stockholm's university, at the department of Computer and System Scienses.
We have based our work on BreezySlam, https://github.com/simondlevy/BreezySLAM.
Our changes are in the Java-folder, where the main-class LOG2PGM have been altered and other classes have been changed and added.

In the folder Simulation, files for simulation scenarios exist. You'll need to download the program V-REP, at http://coppeliarobotics.com/
in order to run them.

To read more about our work, check the folder Thesis for a report on our project.
